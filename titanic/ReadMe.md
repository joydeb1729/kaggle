# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a solution to the Titanic Survival Prediction problem, where the goal is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning models. The project is structured into three main notebooks:

## Notebooks

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Perform initial data exploration and visualization.
   - Analyze the distribution of features and their relationship with survival.
   - Identify patterns and trends to inform feature engineering.

2. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Handle missing values and create new features based on existing ones.
   - Combine and transform features to enhance model performance.
   - Process categorical variables and scale numerical features for optimal modeling.

3. **Modeling**:  
   - Train various machine learning models using PyCaret and evaluate their performance.
   - Fine-tune the chosen model and make predictions on the test dataset.
   - Output the final results for submission.
