    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we focus on building and evaluating machine learning models for predicting survival on the Titanic dataset. The steps involve training a variety of classification models, comparing their performance, and selecting the best-performing model. Additionally, we fine-tune the chosen model and generate predictions on the test data for submission.\n",
