# Spaceship Titanic - Kaggle Competition üèÜ Top 5% (0.80874)

This repository contains my complete solution for the [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) Kaggle competition. The competition involves predicting which passengers were transported to a spaceship, based on the features provided in the dataset. I have used PyCaret for model building and evaluation, along with other tools for data exploration and feature engineering.

## Overview

The goal of this notebook is to predict whether a passenger was transported to a spaceship or not, based on the dataset provided. The dataset contains information about passengers such as their demographics, travel information, and whether they were transported or not.

This repository contains the following three notebooks:
1. **Data Exploration**: Explores and visualizes the dataset, understanding its structure and identifying important features.
2. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Cleans the data, handles missing values, and creates new features for the modeling phase.
3. **Modeling & Evaluation**: Implements machine learning models using PyCaret, evaluates them, and selects the best-performing model.
